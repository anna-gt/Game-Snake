My realisation of classic game "Snake" as graduation project of JavaScript course. The project was assessed according to the usage of:
- animation: CSS, JavaScript, SVG;
- JavaScript multimedia: sound, vibration;
- interactive JavaScript: the web application interacts with the user in various ways (various key combinations, mouse, touchscreen are processed, vibration feedback is used on mobile devices;
- JavaScript communication: the web application also uses AJAX or other communication technologies to store user data and/or exchange data with other users;
- navigation (using SPA): the browser buttons "forward", "back", "refresh" work completely correctly, incl. a warning appears about data loss if a correct transition is not possible
- adaptability to screen size and orientation;
- object-oriented approach
- cross-browser compatibility
